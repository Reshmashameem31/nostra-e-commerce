## 👗 Nostra - Fashion E-Commerce Website

Welcome to *Nostra*, a modern and responsive fashion e-commerce website built as part of my Week 5 project in the web development course. The goal of this project was to build a multi-page fashion website with real-world features using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project helped me understand how to organize code, fix bugs, and implement UI features from scratch. 💪
